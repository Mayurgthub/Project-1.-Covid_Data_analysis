# Project-1.-Covid_Data_analysis
During my internship at iStudio Institute, I worked on big data analysis projects using Python, focusing on COVID-19 case trends and loan dataset insights. I applied data cleaning, visualization, and statistical techniques with pandas, NumPy, and seaborn, building modular scripts to extract meaningful patterns and support decision-making.
